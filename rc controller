pcie rc controllers and mountable video cameras. and please, dear God, if you are going to ship an RC plane or hellicopter to me. make sure it 
workss and is ready to fly. and use fucking magnets in the construction. don't use screws, make it all wireless, and make the range available over
WAN or satellite so if it's an RC plane, I can fly it to coral cove, check the surf and then fly it back to my house. ANd make a fucking useful simulator
that simulates the IRL weather so you can know how to fly the plane. and make the camera able to track so i can find the lineup, fly in circles around the lineup
and just take a stream of the lineup so that i can know if it is any way worth my time to go get some waves.
