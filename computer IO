so we need to be able to record tracks to ableton, vsthost, kristal audio, etcetera and we need 5 din out, digitally controlled analog pcie  modular, additive/subtractive synthesizers and guitar effects pedals. 
pcie analog bluetooth sequencers with programability so that i can sequence my march uds in all sorts of ways, like some notes playing every other step,
some notes playine once and some notes playing almost on all steps
digitally controlled vacuum tube amps (pcie or other connector) 
boss me-10 me-50 etcetera software on the computer, line6 pod and line6 me pedal software downloadable for my computer
pcie (bluetooth optional) analog ability to print tracks and video to 8.5, 8mm film, vinyl, tape, and digitize stuff so i can record 8mm film 
and process, edit, and do augmented reality on it and then splice it and print my augmented reality to it and add new tape only where needed. 

no more wires, make bluetooth solar and battery and wirelessly powered mono, patch, instrument, and amp cables. everything from 5-din, rca, mono, stereo, to slr
digitally controlled analog pcie mixing consoles, vocoders, etcetera

and ability to route my audio liek this. use my asus xonar pcie audio card, but send the audio to bluetooth speakers. 

and you need to cram all of that onto a single pcie or bluetooth card that processes mutltiple signals at the same time so no latency.
