people need to post audio tracks so for a song, each track should be individually downloadable and tabbed out. 
for vidoe, I thought you should include the fuckup clips and some of the raw footage so people can make 10 videos for every video you post. 

It helps with DJing. 

you need to make things free and donation based. and tab out songs and show which effects were used and an oscillosope sample of the sound.
the computer also needs to be able to repair and 3d print new computer components and new crystals and stuff like that. 

analog? why not do this. 300 signals, frequency based router computers backwards compatible with digital computers, but have options like print to 
tape and vinyl..


also, y'all gotta learn how to make things fold.
